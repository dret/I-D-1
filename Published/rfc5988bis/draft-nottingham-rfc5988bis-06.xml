<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>This specification defines a model for the relationships between resources on the Web
(“links”) and the type of those relationships (“link relation types”).</t>

<t>HTML <xref target="W3C.REC-html5-20141028"/> and Atom <xref target="RFC4287"/> both have well-defined concepts of linking;
<xref target="links"/> generalises this into a framework that encompasses linking in these formats and
(potentially) elsewhere.</t>

<t>Furthermore, <xref target="header"/> defines an HTTP header field for conveying such links.</t>

<section anchor="notational-conventions" title="Notational Conventions">

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
“RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/>,<xref target="I-D.leiba-rfc2119-update"/> when, and only when, they appear in
all capitals, as shown here.</t>

<t>This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of <xref target="RFC7230"/>, including the
 #rule, and explicitly includes the following rules from it: quoted-string, token, SP (space),
BWS (bad whitespace), OWS (optional whitespace), RWS (required whitespace) LOALPHA, DIGIT.</t>

<t>Additionally, the following rules are included from <xref target="RFC3986"/>: URI and URI-Reference; from
<xref target="RFC6838"/>: type-name and subtype-name; from <xref target="W3C.REC-css3-mediaqueries-20120619"/>:
media-query-list; and from <xref target="RFC5646"/>: Language-Tag.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="conformance-and-error-handling" title="Conformance and Error Handling">

<t>The requirements regarding conformance and error handling highlighted in <xref target="RFC7230"/>, Section 2.5
apply to this document.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="links" title="Links">

<t>In this specification, a link is a typed connection between two resources, and is comprised of:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A <spanx style="emph">link context</spanx>,</t>
  <t>a <spanx style="emph">link relation type</spanx> (<xref target="link-relation-types"/>),</t>
  <t>a <spanx style="emph">link target</spanx>, and</t>
  <t>optionally, <spanx style="emph">target attributes</spanx> (<xref target="attributes"/>).</t>
</list></t>

<t>A link can be viewed as a statement of the form “<spanx style="emph">link context</spanx> has a <spanx style="emph">link relation type</spanx> resource
at <spanx style="emph">link target</spanx>, which has <spanx style="emph">target attributes</spanx>”.</t>

<t>Link contexts and link targets are both IRIs <xref target="RFC3987"/>. However, in the common case, the link
context will also be a URI <xref target="RFC3986"/>, because many protocols (such as HTTP) do not support
dereferencing IRIs. Likewise, the link target will be sometimes be converted to a URI (see
<xref target="RFC3987"/>, Section 3.1) in serialisations that do not support IRIs (such as the Link header field
defined in <xref target="header"/>).</t>

<t>This specification does not place restrictions on the cardinality of links; there can be multiple
links to and from a particular target, and multiple links of the same or different types between a
given context and target. Likewise, the relative ordering of links in any particular
serialisation, or between serialisations (e.g., the Link header field and in-content links) is not
specified or significant in this specification; applications that wish to consider ordering
significant can do so.</t>

<t>Links are conveyed in <spanx style="emph">link serialisations</spanx>; they are the “bytes on the wire”, and can occur in
various forms. For example, Atom <xref target="RFC4287"/> and HTML <xref target="W3C.REC-html5-20141028"/> both defined
serialisations of links into their respective formats, and <xref target="header"/> defines how to serialise
links in HTTP header fields.</t>

<t>This specification does not define a general syntax for links across different serialisations, nor
does it mandate a specific context for any given link; it is expected that serialisations of links
will specify both aspects.</t>

<t>Finally, links are used by <spanx style="emph">link applications</spanx>. Generally, an application will define the link
relation type(s) it uses, along with the serialisation(s) that they might occur within. For
example, the application “Web browsing” looks for the “stylesheet” link relation type in the HTML
link serialisation (and optionally in the Link header field), whereas the application “AtomPub”
uses the “edit” and “edit-media” link relations in the Atom serialisation.</t>

<section anchor="link-relation-types" title="Link Relation Types">

<t>In the simplest case, a link relation type identifies the semantics of a link. For example, a link
with the relation type “copyright” indicates that the current link context has a copyright resource
at the link target.</t>

<t>Link relation types can also be used to indicate that the target resource has particular
attributes, or exhibits particular behaviours; for example, a “service” link implies that the
link target can be used as part of a defined protocol (in this case, a service description).</t>

<t>Relation types are not to be confused with media types <xref target="RFC2046"/>; they do not identify the format
of the representation that results when the link is dereferenced. Rather, they only describe how
the current context is related to another resource.</t>

<t>Relation types SHOULD NOT infer any additional semantics based upon the presence or absence of
another link relation type, or its own cardinality of occurrence. An exception to this is the
combination of the “alternate” and “stylesheet” registered relation types, which has special
meaning in HTML for historical reasons.</t>

<t>There are two kinds of relation types: registered and extension.</t>

<section anchor="registered" title="Registered Relation Types">

<t>Well-defined relation types can be registered as tokens for convenience and/or to promote reuse by
other applications, using the procedure in <xref target="procedure"/>.</t>

<t>Registered relation type names MUST conform to the reg-rel-type rule (see <xref target="header-type"/>), and
MUST be compared character-by-character in a case-insensitive fashion. They SHOULD be appropriate
to the specificity of the relation type; i.e., if the semantics are highly specific to a particular
application, the name should reflect that, so that more general names are available for less
specific use.</t>

<t>Registered relation types MUST NOT constrain the media type of the link context, and MUST NOT
constrain the available representation media types of the link target. However, they can specify
the behaviours and properties of the target resource (e.g., allowable HTTP methods, request and
response media types that are required be supported).</t>

<t>Historically, registered relation types have been identified with a URI <xref target="RFC3986"/> by prefixing
their names with an application-defined base URI (e.g., see <xref target="atom"/>). This practice is NOT
RECOMMENDED, because the resulting strings will not be considered equivalent to the registered
relation types by other applications. Applications that do use such URIs internally MUST NOT use
them in link serialisations that do not explicitly accommodate them.</t>

<section anchor="procedure" title="Registering Link Relation Types">

<t>The link relations registry is located at <eref target="https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/">https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/</eref>.
Registration requests can be made by following the instructions located there, or by sending an
e-mail to the “link-relations@ietf.org” mailing list.</t>

<t>Registration requests consist of at least the following information:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><spanx style="strong">Relation Name</spanx>: The name of the relation type</t>
  <t><spanx style="strong">Description</spanx>: A short English description of the type’s semantics. It SHOULD be stated in
terms of the relationship between the link context and link target.</t>
  <t><spanx style="strong">Reference</spanx>: Reference to the document that specifies the link relation type,
preferably including a URI that can be used to retrieve a copy of the document. An indication of
the relevant section(s) can also be included, but is not required.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The Expert(s) MAY define additional fields to be collected in the registry.</t>

<t>General requirements for registered relation types are described in <xref target="registered"/>.</t>

<t>Registrations MUST reference a freely available, stable specification.</t>

<t>Note that relation types can be registered by third parties (including the Expert(s)), if the
Expert(s) determine that an unregistered relation type is widely deployed and not likely to be
registered in a timely manner otherwise.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="processing" title="Registration Request Processing">

<t>Relation types are registered on the advice of a Designated Expert (appointed by the IESG or their
delegate), with a Specification Required (using terminology from Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC5226"/>).</t>

<t>The goal of the registry is to reflect common use of links on the Internet. Therefore, the
Expert(s) SHOULD be strongly biased towards approving registrations, unless they are abusive,
frivolous, not likely to be used on the Internet, or actively harmful to the Internet and/or the
Web (not merely aesthetically displeasing, or architecturally dubious). As stated in
<xref target="registered"/>, the Experts MAY withhold registration of names that are too general for the
proposed application.</t>

<t>The Expert(s) MUST clearly identify any issues which cause a registration to be refused. Advice
about the semantics of a proposed link relation type can be given, but if it does not block
registration, this SHOULD be explicitly stated.</t>

<t>When a request is approved, the Expert(s) will inform IANA, and the registration will be processed.
The IESG is the final arbiter of any objection.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="extension-relation-types" title="Extension Relation Types">

<t>Applications that don’t wish to register a relation type can use an extension relation type, which
is a URI <xref target="RFC3986"/> that uniquely identifies the relation type. Although the URI can point to a
resource that contains a definition of the semantics of the relation type, clients SHOULD NOT
automatically access that resource to avoid overburdening its server.</t>

<t>The URI used for an extension relation type SHOULD be under the control of the person or party
defining it, or be delegated to them.</t>

<t>When extension relation types are compared, they MUST be compared as strings (after converting to
URIs if serialised in a different format) in a case-insensitive fashion, character-by-character.
Because of this, all-lowercase URIs SHOULD be used for extension relations.</t>

<t>Note that while extension relation types are required to be URIs, a serialisation of links can
specify that they are expressed in another form, as long as they can be converted to URIs.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="attributes" title="Target Attributes">

<t><spanx style="emph">Target attributes</spanx> are a list of key/value pairs that describe the link or its target; for example,
a media type hint.</t>

<t>They can be defined both by individual link relation types and by link serialisations.</t>

<t>This specification does not attempt to coordinate the name of target attributes, their cardinality
or use. Those creating and maintaining serialisations SHOULD coordinate their target attributes to
avoid conflicts in semantics or syntax, and MAY define their own registries of target attributes.</t>

<t>The names of target attributes SHOULD conform to the token rule, but SHOULD NOT include any of the
characters “%”, “’” or “*”, for portability across serializations, and MUST be compared in a
case-insensitive fashion.</t>

<t>Target attribute definitions SHOULD specify:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The serialisation of their values into Unicode or a subset thereof, to maximise their chances of
portability across link serialisations.</t>
  <t>The semantics and error handling of multiple occurrences of the target attribute on a given link.</t>
</list></t>

<t>This specification does define target attributes for use in the Link HTTP header field in
<xref target="header-attrs"/>.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="header" title="Link Serialisation in HTTP Headers">

<t>The Link header field provides a means for serialising one or more links into HTTP headers.</t>

<t>The ABNF for the field value is:</t>

<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><![CDATA[
  Link       = #link-value
  link-value = "<" URI-Reference ">" *( OWS ";" OWS link-param )
  link-param = token BWS "=" BWS ( token / quoted-string )
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Note that any <spanx style="verb">link-param</spanx> can be generated with values using either the <spanx style="verb">token</spanx> or the
<spanx style="verb">quoted-string</spanx> syntax, and therefore recipients MUST be able to parse both forms. Individual
<spanx style="verb">link-param</spanx>s specify their syntax in terms of the value after any necessary unquoting (as per
<xref target="RFC7230"/>, Section 3.2.6).</t>

<t>This specification defines the link-params “rel”, “anchor”, “rev”, “hreflang”, “media”, “title”,
“title*”, and “type”; see <xref target="header-context"/>, <xref target="header-type"/> and <xref target="header-attrs"/>.</t>

<section anchor="link-target" title="Link Target">

<t>Each link-value conveys one target IRI as a URI-Reference (after conversion to one, if necessary;
see <xref target="RFC3987"/>, Section 3.1) inside angle brackets (“&lt;&gt;”). If the URI-Reference is relative,
parsers MUST resolve it as per <xref target="RFC3986"/>, Section 5. Note that any base IRI appearing in the
message’s content is not applied.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="header-context" title="Link Context">

<t>By default, the context of a link conveyed in the Link header field is the URL of the
representation it is associated with, as defined in <xref target="RFC7231"/>, Section 3.1.4.1, serialised as a
URI.</t>

<t>When present, the anchor parameter overrides this with another URI, such as a fragment of this
resource, or a third resource (i.e., when the anchor value is an absolute URI). If the anchor
parameter’s value is a relative URI, parsers MUST resolve it as per <xref target="RFC3986"/>, Section 5. Note
that any base URI from the body’s content is not applied.</t>

<t>The ABNF for the <spanx style="verb">anchor</spanx> parameter’s value is:</t>

<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><![CDATA[
  URI-Reference ; Section 4.1 of {{RFC3986}}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Link application can choose to ignore links with an anchor parameter. For example, the
application in use might not allow the link context to be assigned to a different resource. In such
cases, the entire link is to be ignored; link applications MUST NOT process the link
without applying the anchor.</t>

<t>Note that depending on HTTP status code and response headers, the link context might be “anonymous”
(i.e., no link context is available). For example, this is the case on a 404 response to a GET
request.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="header-type" title="Relation Type">

<t>The relation type of a link conveyed in the Link header field is conveyed in the “rel” parameter’s
value. The “rel” parameter MUST NOT appear more than once in a given link-value; occurrences after
the first MUST be ignored by parsers.</t>

<t>The “rev” parameter has been used in the past to indicate that the semantics of the relationship
are in the reverse direction. That is, a link from A to B with REL=”X” expresses the same
relationship as a link from B to A with REV=”X”. “rev” is deprecated by this specification because
it often confuses authors and readers; in most cases, using a separate relation type is preferable.</t>

<t>The ABNF for the <spanx style="verb">rel</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">rev</spanx> parameters’ values is:</t>

<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><![CDATA[
  relation-type *( 1*SP relation-type )
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>where:</t>

<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><![CDATA[
  relation-type  = reg-rel-type / ext-rel-type
  reg-rel-type   = LOALPHA *( LOALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-" )
  ext-rel-type   = URI ; Section 3 of {{RFC3986}}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Note that extension relation types are REQUIRED to be absolute URIs in Link header fields, and MUST
be quoted when they contain characters not allowed in tokens, such as semicolon (“;”) or comma
(“,”) (as these characters are used as delimiters in the header field itself).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="header-attrs" title="Target Attributes">

<t>The Link header field defines several target attributes specific to this serialisation, and also
allows extension target attributes. Target attributes are serialised in the Link header field as
parameters (see <xref target="RFC7231"/>, Section 3.1.1.1 for the definition of their syntax).</t>

<section anchor="serialisation-defined-attributes" title="Serialisation-Defined Attributes">

<t>The “hreflang”, “media”, “title”, “title*”, and “type” link-params can be translated to
serialisation-defined target attributes for the link.</t>

<t>The “hreflang” attribute, when present, is a hint indicating what the language of the result of
dereferencing the link should be. Note that this is only a hint; for example, it does not override
the Content-Language header field of a HTTP response obtained by actually following the link.
Multiple “hreflang” attributes on a single link-value indicate that multiple languages are
available from the indicated resource.</t>

<t>The ABNF for the <spanx style="verb">hreflang</spanx> parameter’s value is:</t>

<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><![CDATA[
  Language-Tag
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The “media” attribute, when present, is used to indicate intended destination medium or media for
style information (see <xref target="W3C.REC-html5-20141028"/>, Section 4.2.4). Its value MUST be quoted if it
contains a semicolon (“;”) or comma (“,”). There MUST NOT be more than one “media” attribute in
a link-value; occurrences after the first MUST be ignored by parsers.</t>

<t>The ABNF for the <spanx style="verb">media</spanx> parameter’s value is:</t>

<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><![CDATA[
  media-query-list
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The “title” attribute, when present, is used to label the destination of a link such that it can be
used as a human-readable identifier (e.g., a menu entry) in the language indicated by the
Content-Language header field (if present). The “title” attribute MUST NOT appear more than once in
a given link; occurrences after the first MUST be ignored by parsers.</t>

<t>The “title*” link-param can be used to encode this attribute in a different character set, and/or
contain language information as per <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-rfc5987bis"/>. The “title*” link-param MUST
NOT appear more than once in a given link-value; occurrences after the first MUST be ignored by
parsers. If the attribute does not contain language information, its language is indicated by the
Content-Language header field (when present).</t>

<t>If both the “title” and “title*” link-param appear in a link, applications SHOULD use the
“title*” link-param’s value for the “title” attribute.</t>

<t>The “type” attribute, when present, is a hint indicating what the media type of the result of
dereferencing the link should be. Note that this is only a hint; for example, it does not override
the Content-Type header field of a HTTP response obtained by actually following the link. The
“type” attribute MUST NOT appear more than once in a given link-value; occurrences after the first
MUST be ignored by parsers.</t>

<t>The ABNF for the <spanx style="verb">type</spanx> parameter’s value is:</t>

<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><![CDATA[
  type-name "/" subtype-name ; see {{RFC6838}}, Section 4.2
]]></artwork></figure>

</section>
<section anchor="extension-attributes" title="Extension Attributes">

<t>Other link-params are link-extensions, and are to be considered as target attributes.</t>

<t>Such target attributes MAY be defined to use the encoding in <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-rfc5987bis"/> (e.g.,
“example” and “example*”). When both forms are present, they SHOULD be considered to be the same
target attribute; applications SHOULD use the value of the name ending in “*” (after
<xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-rfc5987bis"/> decoding), but MAY fall back to the other value if there is an
error in decoding it, or if they do not support decoding.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="link-header-field-examples" title="Link Header Field Examples">

<t>For example:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Link: <http://example.com/TheBook/chapter2>; rel="previous";
      title="previous chapter"
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>indicates that “chapter2” is previous to this resource in a logical navigation path.</t>

<t>Similarly,</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Link: </>; rel="http://example.net/foo"
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>indicates that the root resource (“/”) is related to this resource with the extension relation type
“http://example.net/foo”.</t>

<t>This link:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Link: </terms>; rel="copyright"; anchor="#foo"
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>indicates that the linked copyright terms only apply to the portion of the document indicated by
the (media type-specific) fragment identifier “foo”.</t>

<t>The example below shows an instance of the Link header field encoding multiple links, and also the
use of RFC 5987 encoding to encode both non-ASCII characters and language information.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Link: </TheBook/chapter2>;
      rel="previous"; title*=UTF-8'de'letztes%20Kapitel,
      </TheBook/chapter4>;
      rel="next"; title*=UTF-8'de'n%c3%a4chstes%20Kapitel
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Here, both links have titles encoded in UTF-8, use the German language (“de”), and the second link
contains the Unicode code point U+00E4 (“LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS”).</t>

<t>Note that link-values can convey multiple links between the same link target and link context; for
example:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Link: <http://example.org/>;
      rel="start http://example.net/relation/other"
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Here, the link to “http://example.org/” has the registered relation type “start” and the extension
relation type “http://example.net/relation/other”.</t>

<t>Finally, this header field:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Link: <https://example.org/>; rel="start",
      <https://example.org/index>; rel="index"
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>is equivalent to these:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Link: <https://example.org/>; rel="start"
Link: <https://example.org/index>; rel="index"

<t>This specification updates the registration procedures for the Link Relation Type registry; see

<t>The Expert(s) will provide registry data to IANA in a mutually-agreed form (e.g. a specific XML
format). IANA will publish:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The raw registry data</t>

IANA will inform the Expert(s) of this in a mutually agreed way.</t>

<t>Each published document will be at a URL mutually agreed to by IANA and the Expert(s), and IANA
will set HTTP response headers on them as (reasonably) requested by the Expert(s).</t>

<t>Additionally, the HTML generated by IANA will:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Take directions from the Expert(s) as to the content of the HTML page’s introductory text</t>
  <t>Include a stable HTML fragment identifier for each registered link relation</t>

<t>The content of the Link header field is not secure, private or integrity-guaranteed. Use of

<t>Link applications ought to consider the attack vectors opened by automatically following, trusting,
or otherwise using links gathered from HTTP header fields. In particular, Link header fields that
use the “anchor” parameter to associate a link’s context with another resource are to be treated
with due caution.</t>

<t>The Link header field makes extensive use of IRIs and URIs. See <xref target="RFC3987"/> Section 8 for security
considerations relating to IRIs. See <xref target="RFC3986"/> Section 7 for security considerations relating to

<t>Link targets may need to be converted to URIs in order to express them in serialisations that do
not support IRIs. This includes the Link HTTP header field.</t>

<t>Similarly, the anchor parameter of the Link header field does not support IRIs, and therefore IRIs

<section anchor="notes-on-other-link-serialisations" title="Notes on Other Link Serialisations">

<t>Header fields (<xref target="header"/>) are only one serialisation of links; other specifications have defined
alternative serialisations.</t>

<section anchor="html" title="Link Serialisation in HTML">

<t>HTML motivated the original syntax of the Link header field, and many of the design decisions in
this document are driven by a desire to stay compatible with it.</t>

<t>In HTML, the link element can be mapped to links as specified here by using the “href” attribute
for the target URI, and “rel” to convey the relation type, as in the Link header field. The context
of the link is the URI associated with the entire HTML document. HTML also defines several
attributes on links that can be seen as target attributes, including “media”, “hreflang”, “type”
and “sizes”.</t>

<t>Section 4.8 of HTML5 (<xref target="W3C.REC-html5-20141028"/>) defines modern HTML links. That document links to
the Microformats Wiki as a registry; over time, the IANA registry ought to mirror its contents, and
ideally eventually replace it (although that depends on the HTML community).</t>

<t>Surveys of existing HTML content have shown that unregistered link relation types that are not URIs
are (perhaps inevitably) common. Consuming HTML implementations ought not consider such
unregistered short links to be errors, but rather relation types with a local scope (i.e., their
meaning is specific and perhaps private to that document).</t>

<t>Finally, the HTML specification gives a special meaning when the “alternate” relation types
coincides with other relation types in the same link. Such links ought to be serialised in the Link
header field using a single list of relation-types (e.g., rel=”alternate stylesheet”) to preserve
this relationship.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="atom" title="Link Serialisation in Atom">

<t>Atom <xref target="RFC4287"/> is a link serialisation that conveys links in the atom:link element, with the
“href” attribute indicating the link target and the “rel” attribute containing the relation type.
The context of the link is either a feed locator or an entry ID, depending on where it appears;
generally, feed-level links are obvious candidates for transmission as a Link header field.</t>

<t>When serialising an atom:link into a Link header field, it is necessary to convert link targets (if
used) to URIs.</t>

<t>Atom defines extension relation types in terms of IRIs. This specification re-defines them as URIs,
to simplify and reduce errors in their comparison.</t>

<t>Atom allows registered link relation types to be serialised as absolute URIs using a prefix,
“http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/”. This prefix is specific to the Atom serialisation.</t>

<t>Furthermore, link relation types are always compared in a case-sensitive fashion; therefore,
registered link relation types SHOULD be converted to their registered form (usually, lowercase)
when serialised in an Atom document.</t>

<t>Note also that while the Link header field allows multiple relations to be serialised in a single
link, atom:link does not. In this case, a single link-value may map to several atom:link elements.</t>

<t>As with HTML, atom:link defines some attributes that are not explicitly mirrored in the Link header
field syntax, but they can also be used as link-extensions to maintain fidelity.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="parse" title="Algorithms for Parsing Link Header Fields">

<t>This appendix outlines a set of non-normative algorithms: for parsing the Link header(s) out of a
header set, parsing a link header field value, and algorithms for parsing generic parts of the
field value.</t>

<t>These algorithms are more permissive than the ABNF defining the syntax might suggest; the error
handling embodied in them is a reasonable approach, but not one that is required. As such they are
advisory only, and in cases where there is disagreement, the correct behaviour is defined by the
body of this specification.</t>

<section anchor="parse-set" title="Parsing a Header Set for Links">

<t>This algorithm can be used to parse the Link header fields that a HTTP header set contains. Given a
<spanx style="verb">header_set</spanx> of (string <spanx style="verb">field_name</spanx>, string <spanx style="verb">field_value</spanx>) pairs, assuming ASCII encoding, it

<section anchor="changes-from-rfc5988" title="Changes from RFC5988">

<t>This specification has the following differences from its predecessor, RFC5988:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The initial relation type registrations were removed, since they’ve already been registered by
5988.</t>
  <t>The introduction has been shortened.</t>
  <t>The Link Relation Application Data Registry has been removed.</t>
  <t>Incorporated errata.</t>
  <t>Updated references.</t>
  <t>Link cardinality was clarified.</t>
  <t>Terminology was changed from “target IRI” and “context IRI” to “link target” and “link context”
respectively.</t>
  <t>Made assigning a URI to registered relation types serialisation-specific.</t>
  <t>Removed misleading statement that the link header field is semantically equivalent to HTML and
Atom links.</t>
  <t>More carefully defined how the Experts and IANA should interact.</t>
  <t>More carefully defined and used “link serialisations” and “link applications.”</t>
  <t>Clarified the cardinality of target attributes (generically and for “type”).</t>
  <t>Corrected the default link context for the Link header field, to be dependent upon the identity
of the representation (as per RFC7231).</t>
  <t>Defined a suggested parsing algorithm for the Link header.</t>
  <t>The value space of target attributes and their definition has been specified.</t>
  <t>The ABNF has been updated to be compatible with <xref target="RFC7230"/>. In particular, whitespace is now
explicit.</t>
  <t>Some parameters on the HTTP header field can now appear as a token.</t>
  <t>Handling of quoted strings is now defined by <xref target="RFC7230"/>.</t>
  <t>The <spanx style="verb">type</spanx> header field parameter now needs to be quoted (as <spanx style="verb">token</spanx> does not allow “/”).</t>
