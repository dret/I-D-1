<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The IETF, while focused on technical matters, is not neutral about the purpose of its work in
developing the Internet <xref target="RFC3935"/>:</t>

<t><list style='empty'>
  <t>The IETF community wants the Internet to succeed because we believe that the existence of the Internet, and its influence on economics, communication, and education, will help us to build a better human society.</t>
</list></t>

<t>and:</t>

<t><list style='empty'>
  <t>The Internet isn’t value-neutral, and neither is the IETF. We want the Internet to be useful for communities that share our commitment to openness and fairness. We embrace technical concepts such as decentralized control, edge-user empowerment and sharing of resources, because those concepts resonate with the core values of the IETF community. These concepts have little to do with the technology that’s possible, and much to do with the technology that we choose to create.</t>
</list></t>

<t>However, the IETF is most comfortable making what we believe to be purely technical decisions; our
process is defined to favor technical merit, through our well-known bias towards “rough consensus
and running code”.</t>

<t>Nevertheless, the running code that results from our process (when things work well) inevitably has
an impact beyond technical considerations, because the underlying decisions afford some uses while
discouraging others; while we believe we are making purely technical decisions, in reality that may
not be possible. Or, in the words of Lawrence Lessig <xref target="CODELAW"/>:</t>

<t><list style='empty'>
  <t>Ours is the age of cyberspace. It, too, has a regulator… This regulator is code — the software and hardware that make cyberspace as it is. This code, or architecture, sets the terms on which life in cyberspace is experienced. It determines how easy it is to protect privacy, or how easy it is to censor speech. It determines whether access to information is general or whether information is zoned. It affects who sees what, or what is monitored. In a host of ways that one cannot begin to see unless one begins to understand the nature of this code, the code of cyberspace regulates.</t>
</list></t>

<t>This impact has become significant. As the Internet increasingly mediates key functions in
societies, it has unavoidably become profoundly political; it has helped people overthrow
governments and revolutionize social orders, control populations and reveal secrets. It has created
wealth for some individuals and companies, while destroying others’.</t>

<t>All of this raises the question: For whom do we go through the pain of gathering rough consensus
and writing running code?</t>

<t>There are a variety of identifiable parties in the larger Internet community that standards can
provide benefit to, such as (but not limited to) end users, network operators, schools, equipment
vendors, specification authors, specification implementers, content owners, governments,
non-governmental organisations, social movements, employers, and parents.</t>

<t>Successful specifications will provide some benefit to all of the relevant parties, because
standards do not represent a zero-sum game. However, there are sometimes situations where we need to
balance the benefits of a decision between two (or more) parties.</t>

<t>In these situations, when one of those parties is the “end user” of the Internet – for example, a
person using a Web browser, mail client, or other agent that connects to the Internet – we tend to
favour their needs over that of parties such as network operators or equipement vendors.</t>

<t>Our goal is not to avoid all potential harm to or constraint of end users; rather, it’s to give
guidance in a particular situation – when we’ve identified a conflict between the interests of end
users and another stakeholder (e.g., a network operator), and need a “tiebreaker”, we should err on
the side of finding a solution that doesn’t harm end users.</t>

<t>Note that “harm” is not defined in this document; that is something that the relevant body (e.g.,
Working Group) needs to discuss. The IETF has already established a body of guidance for such
decisions, including (but not limited to) <xref target="RFC7754"/> on filtering, <xref target="RFC7258"/> and <xref target="RFC7624"/>
on pervasive surveillance, <xref target="RFC7288"/> on host firewalls, and <xref target="RFC6973"/> regarding privacy
considerations.</t>

<t>Over time, additional guidance is likely to be defined. In the absence of specific guidance on a
given topic (such as that referenced above), this document provides a general approach to making
such decisions.</t>

<t>Doing so helps the IETF achieve its mission, and also helps to assure the long-term health of the
Internet. By prioritising the concerns of end users, we assure that it reaches the greatest number
of people, thereby delivering greater utility by maximising its network effect.</t>

<t>Prioritising end users’ needs also helps to assure that the Internet itself retains end users’ trust, preserving the benefit its network effect brings.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="guidelines-for-ietf-decisions" title="Guidelines for IETF Decisions">

<t>When there are unresolvable conflicts between the interests of different parties, we consider the
end users of the Internet to have priority over other parties.</t>

<t>While networks need to be managed, employers and equipment vendors need to meet business goals, and
so on, the IETF’s mission is to “build a better human society” <xref target="RFC3935"/> and – on the Internet
– society is composed of end users, along with groups of them forming business, governments,
clubs, civil society organizations, and other institutions that influence it.</t>

<t>By “end users,” we mean non-technical users whose activities our protocols are designed to support.
Thus, the end user of a protocol to manage routers is not a router administrator; it is the people
using the network that the router operates within.</t>

<t>This does not mean that the IETF community has any specific insight into what is “good for end
users”; as always, we will need to interact with the greater Internet community and apply our
process to help us make decisions, deploy our protocols, and ultimately determine their success or
failure.</t>

<t>It does means that, because end users are not technical experts, we have a responsibility to
consider their interests, and will need to engage with those who understand how our work will affect
end users, such as civil society organisations, as well as governments, businesses and other groups
representing some aspect of end user interests.</t>

<t>When a proposed solution to a problem has a benefit to some other party at the identified expense
of end users, we will find a different solution or find another way to frame the problem.</t>

<t>There may be cases where genuine technical need requires compromise. However, such tradeoffs need
to be carefully examined, and avoided when there are alternate means of achieving the desired
goals. If they cannot be, these choices and reasoning ought to be carefully documented.</t>

<t>For example, IPv6 <xref target="RFC8200"/> can be used to assign a client with a unique address prefix – even
though this provides a way to track end user activity and helps identify them – because it is
technically necessary to provide networking (and despite this, there are mechanisms like
<xref target="RFC4941"/> to mitigate this effect, for those users who desire it).</t>

<abstract><t>Nodes use IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration to generate addresses using a combination of locally available information and information advertised by routers.  Addresses are formed by combining network prefixes with an interface identifier.  On an interface that contains an embedded IEEE Identifier, the interface identifier is typically derived from it.  On other interface types, the interface identifier is generated through other means, for example, via random number generation.  This document describes an extension to IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration for interfaces whose interface identifier is derived from an IEEE identifier.  Use of the extension causes nodes to generate global scope addresses from interface identifiers that change over time, even in cases where the interface contains an embedded IEEE identifier.  Changing the interface identifier (and the global scope addresses generated from it) over time makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to identify when different addresses used in different transactions actually correspond to the same node.

<title>On Consensus and Humming in the IETF</title>
<author initials='P.' surname='Resnick' fullname='P. Resnick'><organization /></author>
<date year='2014' month='June' />
<abstract><t>The IETF has had a long tradition of doing its technical work through a consensus process, taking into account the different views among IETF participants and coming to (at least rough) consensus on technical matters.  In particular, the IETF is supposed not to be run by a &quot;majority rule&quot; philosophy.  This is why we engage in rituals like &quot;humming&quot; instead of voting.  However, more and more of our actions are now indistinguishable from voting, and quite often we are letting the majority win the day without consideration of minority concerns.  This document explains some features of rough consensus, what is not rough consensus, how we have gotten away from it, how we might think about it differently, and the things we can do in order to really achieve rough consensus.</t><t>Note: This document is quite consciously being put forward as Informational.  It does not propose to change any IETF processes and is therefore not a BCP.  It is simply a collection of principles, hopefully around which the IETF can come to (at least rough) consensus.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.  This openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but it can also allow communications that may be viewed as undesirable by certain parties.  Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms to limit the extent and impact of abusive or objectionable communications.  Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on &quot;blocking&quot; and &quot;filtering&quot;, the active prevention of such communications.  This document examines several technical approaches to Internet blocking and filtering in terms of their alignment with the overall Internet architecture.  When it is possible to do so, the approach to blocking and filtering that is most coherent with the Internet architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially undesirable services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in abusive or objectionable communications.  We observe that certain filtering and blocking approaches can cause unintended consequences to third parties, and we discuss the limits of efficacy of various approaches.</t></abstract>

<title>Reflections on Host Firewalls</title>
<author initials='D.' surname='Thaler' fullname='D. Thaler'><organization /></author>
<date year='2014' month='June' />
<abstract><t>In today's Internet, the need for firewalls is generally accepted in the industry, and indeed firewalls are widely deployed in practice. Unlike traditional firewalls that protect network links, host firewalls run in end-user systems.  Often the result is that software may be running and potentially consuming resources, but then communication is blocked by a host firewall.  It's taken for granted that this end state is either desirable or the best that can be achieved in practice, rather than (for example) an end state where the relevant software is not running or is running in a way that would not result in unwanted communication.  In this document, we explore the issues behind these assumptions and provide suggestions on improving the architecture going forward.</t></abstract>
