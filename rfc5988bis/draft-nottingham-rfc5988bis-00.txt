1.  Introduction

   A means of indicating the relationships between resources on the Web,
   as well as indicating the type of those relationships, has been
   available for some time in HTML [W3C.REC-html401-19991224], and more
   recently in Atom [RFC4287].  These mechanisms, although conceptually
   similar, are separately specified.  However, links between resources
   need not be format specific; it can be useful to have typed links
   that are independent of their serialisation, especially when a
   resource has representations in multiple formats.

   To this end, this document defines a framework for typed links that
   isn't specific to a particular serialisation or application.  It does
   so by redefining the link relation registry established by Atom to
   have a broader domain, and adding to it the relations that are
   defined by HTML.

   Furthermore, an HTTP header field for conveying typed links was
   defined in Section 19.6.2.4 of [RFC2068], but removed from [RFC2616],
   due to a lack of implementation experience.  Since then, it has been
   implemented in some User Agents (e.g., for stylesheets), and several
   additional use cases have surfaced.

   Because it was removed, the status of the Link header is unclear,
   leading some to consider minting new application-specific HTTP
   headers instead of reusing it.  This document addresses this by re-
   specifying the Link header as one such serialisation, with updated
   but backwards-compatible syntax.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119], as
   scoped to those conformance targets.

   This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of
   [RFC2616], and explicitly includes the following rules from it:
   quoted-string, token, SP (space), LOALPHA, DIGIT.

   Additionally, the following rules are included from [RFC3986]: URI
   and URI-Reference; from [RFC4288]: type-name and subtype-name; from
   [W3C.REC-html401-19991224]: MediaDesc; from [RFC5646]: Language-Tag;
   and from [RFC5987], ext-value and parmname.

3.  Links

   In this specification, a link is a typed connection between two
   resources that are identified by Internationalised Resource
   Identifiers (IRIs) [RFC3987], and is comprised of:

   o  A context IRI,

   o  a link relation type (Section 4),

   o  a target IRI, and

   o  optionally, target attributes.

   A link can be viewed as a statement of the form "{context IRI} has a
   {relation type} resource at {target IRI}, which has {target
   attributes}".

   Note that in the common case, the context IRI will also be a URI
   [RFC3986], because many protocols (such as HTTP) do not support
   dereferencing IRIs.  Likewise, the target IRI will be converted to a
   URI (see [RFC3987], Section 3.1) in serialisations that do not
   support IRIs (e.g., the Link header).

   This specification does not place restrictions on the cardinality of
   links; there can be multiple links to and from a particular IRI, and
   multiple links of different types between two given IRIs.  Likewise,
   the relative ordering of links in any particular serialisation, or
   between serialisations (e.g., the Link header and in-content links)
   is not specified or significant in this specification; applications
   that wish to consider ordering significant can do so.

   Target attributes are a set of key/value pairs that describe the link
   or its target; for example, a media type hint.  This specification
   does not attempt to coordinate their names or use, but does provide
   common target attributes for use in the Link HTTP header.

   Finally, this specification does not define a general syntax for
   expressing links, nor does it mandate a specific context for any
   given link; it is expected that serialisations of links will specify
   both aspects.  One such serialisation is communication of links
   through HTTP headers, specified in Section 5.

4.  Link Relation Types

   In the simplest case, a link relation type identifies the semantics
   of a link.  For example, a link with the relation type "copyright"
   indicates that the resource identified by the target IRI is a



Nottingham                Expires May 29, 2014                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                 Web Linking                 November 2013


   statement of the copyright terms applying to the current context IRI.

   Link relation types can also be used to indicate that the target
   resource has particular attributes, or exhibits particular
   behaviours; for example, a "service" link implies that the identified
   resource is part of a defined protocol (in this case, a service
   description).

   Relation types are not to be confused with media types [RFC4288];
   they do not identify the format of the representation that results
   when the link is dereferenced.  Rather, they only describe how the
   current context is related to another resource.

   Relation types SHOULD NOT infer any additional semantics based upon
   the presence or absence of another link relation type, or its own
   cardinality of occurrence.  An exception to this is the combination
   of the "alternate" and "stylesheet" registered relation types, which
   has special meaning in HTML4 for historical reasons.

   There are two kinds of relation types: registered and extension.

4.1.  Registered Relation Types

   Well-defined relation types can be registered as tokens for
   convenience and/or to promote reuse by other applications.  This
   specification establishes an IANA registry of such relation types;
   see Section 6.2.

   Registered relation type names MUST conform to the reg-rel-type rule,
   and MUST be compared character-by-character in a case-insensitive
   fashion.  They SHOULD be appropriate to the specificity of the
   relation type; i.e., if the semantics are highly specific to a
   particular application, the name should reflect that, so that more
   general names are available for less specific use.

   Registered relation types MUST NOT constrain the media type of the
   context IRI, and MUST NOT constrain the available representation
   media types of the target IRI.  However, they can specify the
   behaviours and properties of the target resource (e.g., allowable
   HTTP methods, request and response media types that must be
   supported).

   Additionally, specific applications of linking may require additional
   data to be included in the registry.  For example, Web browsers might
   want to know what kinds of links should be downloaded when they
   archive a Web page; if this application-specific information is in
   the registry, new link relation types can control this behaviour
   without unnecessary coordination.

Internet-Draft                 Web Linking                 November 2013


   To accommodate this, per-entry application data can be added to the
   Link Relation Type registry, by registering it in the Link Relation
   Application Data registry (Section 6.3).

4.2.  Extension Relation Types

   Applications that don't wish to register a relation type can use an
   extension relation type, which is a URI [RFC3986] that uniquely
   identifies the relation type.  Although the URI can point to a
   resource that contains a definition of the semantics of the relation
   type, clients SHOULD NOT automatically access that resource to avoid
   overburdening its server.

   When extension relation types are compared, they MUST be compared as
   strings (after converting to URIs if serialised in a different
   format, such as a Curie [W3C.CR-curie-20090116]) in a case-
   insensitive fashion, character-by-character.  Because of this, all-
   lowercase URIs SHOULD be used for extension relations.

   Note that while extension relation types are required to be URIs, a
   serialisation of links can specify that they are expressed in another
   form, as long as they can be converted to URIs.

5.  The Link Header Field

   The Link entity-header field provides a means for serialising one or
   more links in HTTP headers.  It is semantically equivalent to the
   <LINK> element in HTML, as well as the atom:link feed-level element
   in Atom [RFC4287].

   reg-rel-type   = LOALPHA *( LOALPHA | DIGIT | "." | "-" )
   ext-rel-type   = URI

5.1.  Target IRI

   Each link-value conveys one target IRI as a URI-Reference (after
   conversion to one, if necessary; see [RFC3987], Section 3.1) inside
   angle brackets ("<>").  If the URI-Reference is relative, parsers
   MUST resolve it as per [RFC3986], Section 5.  Note that any base IRI
   from the message's content is not applied.

5.2.  Context IRI

   By default, the context of a link conveyed in the Link header field
   is the IRI of the requested resource.

   When present, the anchor parameter overrides this with another URI,
   such as a fragment of this resource, or a third resource (i.e., when
   the anchor value is an absolute URI).  If the anchor parameter's
   value is a relative URI, parsers MUST resolve it as per [RFC3986],
   Section 5.  Note that any base URI from the body's content is not

Internet-Draft                 Web Linking                 November 2013


   applied.

   Consuming implementations can choose to ignore links with an anchor
   parameter.  For example, the application in use may not allow the
   context IRI to be assigned to a different resource.  In such cases,
   the entire link is to be ignored; consuming implementations MUST NOT
   process the link without applying the anchor.

   Note that depending on HTTP status code and response headers, the
   context IRI might be "anonymous" (i.e., no context IRI is available).
   For instance, this is the case on a 404 response to a GET request.

5.3.  Relation Type

   The relation type of a link is conveyed in the "rel" parameter's
   value.  The "rel" parameter MUST NOT appear more than once in a given
   link-value; occurrences after the first MUST be ignored by parsers.

   The "rev" parameter has been used in the past to indicate that the
   semantics of the relationship are in the reverse direction.  That is,
   a link from A to B with REL="X" expresses the same relationship as a
   link from B to A with REV="X". "rev" is deprecated by this
   specification because it often confuses authors and readers; in most
   cases, using a separate relation type is preferable.

   Note that extension relation types are REQUIRED to be absolute URIs
   in Link headers, and MUST be quoted if they contain a semicolon (";")
   or comma (",") (as these characters are used as delimiters in the
   header itself).

5.4.  Target Attributes

   The "hreflang", "media", "title", "title*", "type", and any link-
   extension link-params are considered to be target attributes for the
   link.

   The "hreflang" parameter, when present, is a hint indicating what the
   language of the result of dereferencing the link should be.  Note
   that this is only a hint; for example, it does not override the
   Content-Language header of a HTTP response obtained by actually
   following the link.  Multiple "hreflang" parameters on a single link-
   value indicate that multiple languages are available from the
   indicated resource.

   The "media" parameter, when present, is used to indicate intended
   destination medium or media for style information (see
   [W3C.REC-html401-19991224], Section 6.13).  Note that this may be
   updated by [W3C.CR-css3-mediaqueries-20090915]).  Its value MUST be

Internet-Draft                 Web Linking                 November 2013


   quoted if it contains a semicolon (";") or comma (","), and there
   MUST NOT be more than one "media" parameter in a link-value.

   The "title" parameter, when present, is used to label the destination
   of a link such that it can be used as a human-readable identifier
   (e.g., a menu entry) in the language indicated by the Content-
   Language header (if present).  The "title" parameter MUST NOT appear
   more than once in a given link-value; occurrences after the first
   MUST be ignored by parsers.

   The "title*" parameter can be used to encode this label in a
   different character set, and/or contain language information as per
   [RFC5987].  The "title*" parameter MUST NOT appear more than once in
   a given link-value; occurrences after the first MUST be ignored by
   parsers.  If the parameter does not contain language information, its
   language is indicated by the Content-Language header (when present).

   If both the "title" and "title*" parameters appear in a link-value,
   processors SHOULD use the "title*" parameter's value.

   The "type" parameter, when present, is a hint indicating what the
   media type of the result of dereferencing the link should be.  Note
   that this is only a hint; for example, it does not override the
   Content-Type header of a HTTP response obtained by actually following
   the link.  There MUST NOT be more than one type parameter in a link-
   value.

5.5.  Examples

   For example:

   Link: <http://example.com/TheBook/chapter2>; rel="previous";
         title="previous chapter"

   indicates that "chapter2" is previous to this resource in a logical
   navigation path.

   Similarly,

   Link: </>; rel="http://example.net/foo"

   indicates that the root resource ("/") is related to this resource
   with the extension relation type "http://example.net/foo".

   The example below shows an instance of the Link header encoding
   multiple links, and also the use of RFC 2231 encoding to encode both
   non-ASCII characters and language information.

   Link: </TheBook/chapter2>;

         </TheBook/chapter4>;
         rel="next"; title*=UTF-8'de'n%c3%a4chstes%20Kapitel

   Here, both links have titles encoded in UTF-8, use the German
   language ("de"), and the second link contains the Unicode code point
   U+00E4 ("LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS").

   Note that link-values can convey multiple links between the same
   target and context IRIs; for example:

   Link: <http://example.org/>;
         rel="start http://example.net/relation/other"

   Here, the link to "http://example.org/" has the registered relation
   type "start" and the extension relation type
   "http://example.net/relation/other".

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Link HTTP Header Registration

   This specification updates the Message Header registry entry for
   "Link" in HTTP [RFC3864] to refer to this document.

   Header field: Link
   Applicable protocol: http
   Status: standard
   Author/change controller:
       IETF  (iesg@ietf.org)
       Internet Engineering Task Force
   Specification document(s):

6.2.  Link Relation Type Registry

   This specification establishes the Link Relation Type registry, and
   updates Atom [RFC4287] to refer to it in place of the "Registry of
   Link Relations".

   The underlying registry data (e.g., the XML file) must include
   Simplified BSD License text as described in Section 4.e of the Trust
   Legal Provisions (<http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info>).

6.2.1.  Registering New Link Relation Types

   Relation types are registered on the advice of a Designated Expert
   (appointed by the IESG or their delegate), with a Specification
   Required (using terminology from [RFC5226]).

   The requirements for registered relation types are described in
   Section 4.1.

   Registration requests consist of the completed registration template
   below, typically published in an RFC or Open Standard (in the sense
   described by [RFC2026], Section 7).  However, to allow for the
   allocation of values prior to publication, the Designated Expert may
   approve registration once they are satisfied that a specification
   will be published.

   Note that relation types can be registered by third parties, if the
   Designated Expert determines that an unregistered relation type is
   widely deployed and not likely to be registered in a timely manner.

   The registration template is:

   o  Relation Name:

   o  Description:

   o  Reference:

   o  Notes: [optional]

   o  Application Data: [optional]

   Registration requests should be sent to the link-relations@ietf.org
   mailing list, marked clearly in the subject line (e.g., "NEW RELATION
   - example" to register an "example" relation type).

   Within at most 14 days of the request, the Designated Expert(s) will
   either approve or deny the registration request, communicating this
   decision to the review list and IANA.  Denials should include an
   explanation and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the
   request successful.

   Decisions (or lack thereof) made by the Designated Expert can be
   first appealed to Application Area Directors (contactable using
   app-ads@tools.ietf.org email address or directly by looking up their
   email addresses on http://www.iesg.org/ website) and, if the
   appellant is not satisfied with the response, to the full IESG (using
   the iesg@iesg.org mailing list).

   IANA should only accept registry updates from the Designated
   Expert(s), and should direct all requests for registration to the
   review mailing list.

6.3.  Link Relation Application Data Registry

   This specification also establishes the Link Relation Application
   Field registry, to allow entries in the Link Relation Type registry
   to be extended with application-specific data (hereafter, "app data")
   specific to all instances of a given link relation type.

   Application data is registered on the advice of a Designated Expert
   (appointed by the IESG or their delegate), with a Specification
   Required (using terminology from [RFC5226]).

   Registration requests consist of the completed registration template
   below:

   o  Application Name:

   o  Description:

   o  Default Value:

   o  Notes: [optional]

   The Description SHOULD identify the value space of the app data.  The
   Default Value MUST be appropriate to entries to which the app data
   does not apply.

   Entries that pre-date the addition of app data will automatically be
   considered to have the default value for that app data; if there are
   exceptions, the modification of such entries should be coordinated by
   the Designated Expert(s), in consultation with the author of the
   proposed app data as well as the registrant of the existing entry (if
   possible).

   Registration requests should be sent to the link-relations@ietf.org
   mailing list, marked clearly in the subject line (e.g., "NEW APP DATA
   - example" to register "example" app data).

   Within at most 14 days of the request, the Designated Expert will
   either approve or deny the registration request, communicating this
   decision to the review list.  Denials should include an explanation
   and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request
   successful.  Registration requests that are undetermined for a period
   longer than 21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention (using the
   iesg@iesg.org mailing list) for resolution.

   When a registration request is successful, the Designated Expert will
   forward it to IANA for publication.  IANA should only accept registry
   updates from the Designated Expert(s), and should direct all requests
   for registration to the review mailing list.

7.  Security Considerations

   The content of the Link header field is not secure, private or
   integrity-guaranteed, and due caution should be exercised when using
   it.  Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) with HTTP ([RFC2818] and
   [RFC2817]) is currently the only end-to-end way to provide such
   protection.

   Applications that take advantage of typed links should consider the
   attack vectors opened by automatically following, trusting, or
   otherwise using links gathered from HTTP headers.  In particular,
   Link headers that use the "anchor" parameter to associate a link's
   context with another resource should be treated with due caution.

   The Link entity-header field makes extensive use of IRIs and URIs.
   See [RFC3987] for security considerations relating to IRIs.  See
   [RFC3986] for security considerations relating to URIs.  See
   [RFC2616] for security considerations relating to HTTP headers.

8.  Internationalisation Considerations

   Target IRIs may need to be converted to URIs in order to express them
   in serialisations that do not support IRIs.  This includes the Link
   HTTP header.

   Similarly, the anchor parameter of the Link header does not support
   IRIs, and therefore IRIs must be converted to URIs before inclusion
   there.  Relation types are defined as URIs, not IRIs, to aid in their
   comparison.  It is not expected that they will be displayed to end
   users.

Appendix A.  Notes on Using the Link Header with the HTML4 Format

   HTML motivated the original syntax of the Link header, and many of
   the design decisions in this document are driven by a desire to stay
   compatible with these uses.

   In HTML4, the link element can be mapped to links as specified here
   by using the "href" attribute for the target URI, and "rel" to convey
   the relation type, as in the Link header.  The context of the link is
   the URI associated with the entire HTML document.

   All of the link relation types defined by HTML4 have been included in
   the Link Relation Type registry, so they can be used without
   modification.  However, there are several potential ways to serialise
   extension relation types into HTML4, including

   o  As absolute URIs,

   o  using the document-wide "profile" attribute's URI as a prefix for
      relation types, or

   o  using the RDFa [W3C.REC-rdfa-syntax-20081014] convention of
      mapping token prefixes to URIs (in a manner similar to XML name
      spaces) (note that RDFa is only defined to work in XHTML
      [W3C.REC-xhtml-basic-20080729], but is sometimes used in HTML4).

   Individual applications of linking will therefore need to define how
   their extension links should be serialised into HTML4.

   Surveys of existing HTML content have shown that unregistered link
   relation types that are not URIs are (perhaps inevitably) common.
   Consuming HTML implementations should not consider such unregistered
   short links to be errors, but rather relation types with a local

   scope (i.e., their meaning is specific and perhaps private to that
   document).

   HTML4 also defines several attributes on links that are not
   explicitly defined by the Link header.  These attributes can be
   serialised as link-extensions to maintain fidelity.

   Finally, the HTML4 specification gives a special meaning when the
   "alternate" and "stylesheet" relation types coincide in the same
   link.  Such links should be serialised in the Link header using a
   single list of relation-types (e.g., rel="alternate stylesheet") to
   preserve this relationship.

Appendix B.  Notes on Using the Link Header with the Atom Format

   Atom conveys links in the atom:link element, with the "href"
   attribute indicating the target IRI and the "rel" attribute
   containing the relation type.  The context of the link is either a
   feed IRI or an entry ID, depending on where it appears; generally,
   feed-level links are obvious candidates for transmission as a Link
   header.

   When serialising an atom:link into a Link header, it is necessary to
   convert target IRIs (if used) to URIs.

   Atom defines extension relation types in terms of IRIs.  This
   specification re-defines them as URIs, to simplify and reduce errors
   in their comparison.

   Atom allows registered link relation types to be serialised as
   absolute URIs.  Such relation types SHOULD be converted to the
   appropriate registered form (e.g.,
   "http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/self" to "self") so that
   they are not mistaken for extension relation types.

   Furthermore, Atom link relation types are always compared in a case-
   sensitive fashion; therefore, registered link relation types SHOULD
   be converted to their registered form (usually, lowercase) when
   serialised in an Atom document.

   Note also that while the Link header allows multiple relations to be
   serialised in a single link, atom:link does not.  In this case, a
   single link-value may map to several atom:link elements.

   As with HTML, atom:link defines some attributes that are not
   explicitly mirrored in the Link header syntax, but they can also be
   used as link-extensions to maintain fidelity.
