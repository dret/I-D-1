<t>This specification defines a HTTP/2 setting, SETTINGS_FIXED_FRAME_SIZE, that asks the peer to use padding and chunking to achieve a desired, static frame size for HEADERS and DATA frames.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Traffic analysis depends, in part, on using the difference between sizes of messages to characterise a particular flow.</t>

<t>HTTP/2 <xref target="RFC7540"/> allows its two major data-bearing frame types (HEADERS and DATA) to be split into multiple frames as well as padded with extra data. However, implementations to date do not use these capabilities in any regular way to combat traffic analysis.</t>

<t>This specification defines a new HTTP/2 setting that informs a peer when it is desirable to use frame splitting and padding to achieve this effect.</t>

<section anchor="notational-conventions" title="Notational Conventions">

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
“RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in
<xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="settingsfixedframesize-0xn" title="SETTINGS_FIXED_FRAME_SIZE (0xn)">

<t>This setting requests that the peer assure that HTTP/2 frame payloads (as per <xref target="RFC7540"/>, Section 4.1) it sends are split into multiple frames and/or padded to the number of bytes indicated in its value, when the frame type allows.</t>

<t>A value of 0 indicates no fixed frame size is requested.</t>

<t>For example, if the setting value is 8192, a 10000 byte DATA frame payload would be sent as two 8192 byte frames, with 1808 bytes of padding in total (occurring in either frame, or both).</t>

<t>HEADERS frames would likewise be split into one HEADERS frame and an arbitrary number of CONTINUATION frames, with padding as necessary.</t>

<t>This specification registers an entry in the HTTP/2 Settings registry.</t>

  <t>Name: SETTINGS_FIXED_FRAME_SIZE</t>
  <t>Code: TBD</t>
  <t>Initial Value: 0</t>

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>Uniform frame sizes are not sufficient to combat traffic analysis on their own, since flows still carry metadata, timing, and other information.</t>

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

<list>
<t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.
</t></list></t>
<t>
   Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
   level of the document in which they are used.

<abstract><t>This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), referred to as HTTP version 2 (HTTP/2).  HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection.  It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients.</t><t>This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax.  HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.</t></abstract>
