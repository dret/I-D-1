    <h1>drafts</h1>

    <p>These are links to the most recent editors' copies of the draft specifications I'm currently working on in the IETF. Those that are adopted by Working Groups usually (but not always) go into that group's repository, rather than here (e.g., see <a href="https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions#draft-http-extension-specifications">the HTTP Working Group</a>).</p>
    
    <p>Source and issues are kept in <a href="https://github.com/mnot/I-D/">Github</a>.</p>
